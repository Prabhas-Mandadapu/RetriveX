# RetriveX
multimodel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) for OFFLINE mode that can ingest, index, and query diverse data formats such as DOC, PDF, Images and voice recordings within a unified semantic retrieval framework


# 🧠 Multi-Modal Offline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

An **offline, privacy-preserving AI-powered knowledge retrieval system** that enables **natural language querying across multiple data formats** such as PDFs, Word documents, images, and audio files using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture with **local Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
